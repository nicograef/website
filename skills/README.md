## Typical Workflow

1. **Clarify** → gather requirements
2. **Write a PRD** → formalise into a document
3. **Create Plan** → break PRD into vertical slices
4. **Implement Plan** → agent executes slices (with **TDD**)
   — OR **Guided Implementation** → developer writes all code, agent coaches
5. **Code Audit** → review the result
6. **Improve Architecture** → identify deepening opportunities
